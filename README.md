Solutions, written in C, to Gayle Laakmann McDowell's book 'Cracking the Coding Interview.' Bits and peices were taken from her solutions in Java.

In addition, I've taken source code from several books. In general, I've consulted
* K&R, The C Programming language,
* Samuel P Harbison III and Guy L. Steele Jr., C - A Reference Manual,
* Steven S. Skiena, The Algorithm Design Manual,
* Noah Kindler, Programming Interviews Exposed.

Some data structures and algorithms are seperated written for reference, although all the code is rewritten in each exercise file if used.
